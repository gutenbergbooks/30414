<h2>JUSTISS FOR THE PORE.</h2>

<p>I've jest been told another staggerer. Well, it seems then that, in one
of the werry largest and werry poppularest of all the Citty Parishes,
sum grand old Cristian Patriots of the holden times left lots of money,
when they was ded, and didn't want it no more, to be given to the Pore
of the Parish, for warious good and charitable hobjecs, such as for
rewarding good and respectabel Female Servants as managed to keep their
places for at least four years, in despite of rampageous Marsters, and
crustaceous Missuses; also for selling Coles to werry Pore Peeple at
sumthink like four pence per hundredweight, be the reglar price what it
may; also for paying what's called, I think, premeums for putting Pore
Boys or Pore Gals as aprentisses to warious trades, so as to lern and
laber truly to get a good living when they growd up, insted of loafing
about in dirt and hignorence; likewise for allowing little pensions to
poor old women as is a striving all their mite and main to keep
themselves out of the hated Workhouse; and there are seweral other
similar good purposes as the good Citizens of old left their money for,
and hundreds if not thowsands of pore but honest men and women has had
good cause to be grateful to 'em for their kind and pious thortfulness.</p>

<p>Well, I hardly xpecs to be bleeved when I says, that a law has been
passed that allows sutten werry respectabel but werry hignerant Gents,
called Charity Commissioners, to sweep away ewerry one of those truly
charitable hinstitutions, and to make use of all this money somewheres
else, and for sum other objecs, and for sum other peeple!</p>

<p>I ain't so werry much supprized as I ort to be, to learn that the ouse
of Commons&mdash;ouse of "Short Commons," I shud call 'em&mdash;has passed this
most wicked Law, <i>cos werry pore peeple ain't got no votes</i>; but I do
confess as I am supprised at the most respectabel and harrystocrattick
House of Lords a condesendin not merely to rob a pore man of his Beer,
but to rob a poor Made Servant of her 2 Ginneys reward for behaviour
like a Angel for four long weary years in the same place, be it a good
'un or a werry ard 'un, and to purwent a lot of pore hard working Men
and Women from getting their little stock of Coles in at about a quarter
of the reglar price! In course it ain't to be supposed as Washupfool
Books and Honnerabel Markisses can know or care much about the price of
Coals, altho there is one Most Honnerabel Markis, from whom I bort a
hole Tun larst year at rayther a high figger, who coud have told em, and
shood have told em all about it, tho' praps he's agin cheap Coles on
principal. And besides all this, it won't I shood think, be a werry
plezzant thort to come across a Noble Dook's or a Wirtuous Wiscount's
mind&mdash;if such eminent swells has em, like the rest on us&mdash;when they sees
a lot of dirty raggid boys and gals a loafing about the streets, to
think that if the money that was left hundreds of years ago by good men,
had been still used <i>as it was ordered to be used</i>, and has been used
for sentrys, these same raggid boys and gals wood have bin a learning of
some useful trade by which they might have hearnd a desent living.</p>

<p>In course I can hear, with my mind's ear, as <i>Amlet</i> says, my thowsends
of simperthising readers shouting out, "What's the use of your crying
over spilt milk?" Well, none, of course, but I happens to have herd that
there's still <i>jest one chance left</i>. It seems that there is what's
called, I think, "<i>a appeal</i>" to sum werry heminent Swells called "the
Lords of the uncommon Counsel on Eddication," and the kind-hearted
Church Wardens, as I has before eluded to, means to make one; and ewery
kind-hearted Cristian Man and Woman as reads my truthful statement, and
can feel, as me, and Lords, and Ladies as well, can, and ort to, and
must feel, will wish 'em thurrur suksess in their good, and kind, and
mussiful atemt to hobtane justiss for them as carnt no hows obtane it
for theirselves.</p>

<h2>HOW WE DO BUSINESS NOW.</h2>

<h4>BEAR COURT CHAMBERS, BULL LANE, E.C.</h4>

<center><span class="smcap">Circular</span> 1059.</center><br />

<center><span class="smcap">Telegraphic Address</span>&mdash;SPIDER.</center>

<center><span class="smcap">Telephone Number</span>&mdash;BILLION.</center>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Now is <i>the</i> time to remit to me for the forthcoming big
movements I intend to make during the current Month. If my last Circular
proved true down to the very last letter, this one will be ten times
truer. What did I say last month? I said there would be a big rise in
Boomerang Rails, which were then at 11¾. In 57½ hours after my
Circular was issued they had risen to 110-7/16, and many of my clients
made thousands of pounds. One of them actually making the magnificent
sum of &pound;27,876 11s. 4¼<i>d.</i> I love to be accurate, so I give the exact
amount.</p>

<p>Now is the time, I repeat. No one out of the millions of clients, from
an Exalted Lady, whom delicacy forbids me to name, down to the junior
waiter at the Pomona, ever lost by coming to me. I also advised, and I
repeat it this month,</p>

<h4>CHUCKSTER TOLL BAR BINKSES.</h4>

<p>They were hardly quoted on the Stock Exchange&mdash;hardly known even&mdash;when I
took them up on the 1st of April last year. Where are they now? At 119!
And they will move on to 219 before the year ends. I have means of
information possessed by none besides me. I have a wire of my own laid
on to every Embassy house on the Continent; every <i>attach&eacute;</i>, every
dragoman is my correspondent, and more than one Crowned Head has
honoured me with the secrets of his last Council, or of his resolves on
War or Peace. I myself am a Power. I can make and unmake and ruin homes
as well as any Czar or Emperor.</p>

<blockquote>But I bind the clients who trust me with bands of iron.<br />

Again I say buy</blockquote>

<h4>CHUCKSTER TOLL BAR BINKSES.</h4>

<p>Remit the necessary Cover to me at once. Small sums combined make large
ones, and you cannot be in too soon. Five-pence (a sum you would throw
at a crossing-sweeper) covers Five Pounds. Here is my scale:&mdash;</p>

<div class='centered table'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="scale of charges">
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound;1</td><td>covers</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound;1000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound;5</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound;5000.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&pound;20</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td><td>&pound;200,000.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>But send me whatever you like, and it will prove the most important act
of your life; one you will never forget.</p>

<blockquote>Again I say buy</blockquote>

<h4>CHUCKSTER TOLL BAR BINKSES.</h4>

<p>There is fascination in their very name. Don't do the thing weakly. Act
on the advice of that great man <span class="smcap">Barry Lyndon</span>, and speculate grandly.
Take the history of one out of thousands of fortunes made by me for
others:&mdash;</p>

<p>A BANK CLERK, hard up, desperately pressed by his duns, had received a
small remittance from his father, a struggling Clergyman. The sum
amounted to &pound;50, just enough to pay the young fellow's bills, and leave
him a paltry sovereign. Do you think he was such a fool as to have read
my Circular in vain? He very wisely brought the money to me. I bought
Boomerangs at 11¾. In 57½ hours that young man was a
<i>millionnaire</i>. He has magnificent chambers on the Embankment; shows
himself in the Row at the present time; would not look at a cigar under
half-a-crown; and has not entirely forgotten the claims of his family,
for to my knowledge he has remitted several pounds to his younger
brothers.&mdash;Again I say,</p>

<h4>BUY BOOMERANGS OR CHUCKSTERS.</h4>

<p>One Word of Caution, and I conclude Circular 1059. <span class="smcap">Be very Cautious of
Some People I know</span>. Once trust yourself to them, and it is all
U.P.&mdash;Wire immediately (<i>and send the necessary cover</i>) to</p>

<p class="regards">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="author">ZACH. SPYDUR.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;When once you have tasted the joys of speculation, you will think
and care for nothing else. The click of the Tape Machine is music to
you. I have one going all night in my bed-room.</p>

<h2>"I'LL CALL THEE HAMLET."</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benson</span>, the enterprising young Lessee of the Globe Theatre, on two
evenings of the week affords a spectacle of the greatest possible
interest to every Shakspearian student. His <i>Hamlet</i> is rather given to
noisy declamation when greatly moved, but, barring this, seems to be a
thoroughly good-natured harmless creature, who, as fond of dabbling in
private theatricals, would probably be hailed as an acquisition at the
Meistersingers Club and cognate institutions. The innovations introduced
into the action relieve the gloom of the Tragedy. Take for instance, the
treatment of <i>Ophelia</i>, which is full of quiet humour. That she should
look as old as <i>Hamlet's</i> Mother, is of course, accidental, and is
purely attributable to the Globe <i>Gertrude</i> being exceptionally comely
and youthful, still it has a very quaint effect. But the idea of the
unfortunate maid, after she has committed suicide, being carried <i>&agrave; la</i>
<span class="smcap">Guy Faux</span> into the throne-room with a sort of "See what we have found"
air, is broadly comic. The funeral with its "maimed rites," is also very
funny. Apparently, the Bishop (whose garb, by the way, seems to be a
compromise between an eccentric Jewish Rabbi and that of a decidedly
demented Roman Catholic Priest) has "contracted" for the procession,
with the result of collecting together a heterogeneous company,
consisting of modern High Church curates, a few members of some humorous
Confraternity, and a sprinkling of other amusing grotesques. But the fun
reaches its climax, when the body of <i>Ophelia</i> herself is produced in,
what seemed to me to be, <i>a hamper</i>! The above example of what is being
done twice a week in Newcastle Street, Strand, will show how well worthy
of the scholar's notice is the present revival of <i>Hamlet</i> at the Globe
Theatre. As actors, Mr. <span class="smcap">Benson's</span> company are not entirely satisfactory.
As thinkers, however, they are worthy of the greatest possible respect.
Under these circumstances, it is to be hoped, that should they
ultimately, for sufficient reason, decide to give up acting, they will
yet resolve to continue what they do so well, and, in three words&mdash;go on
thinking.</p>

<p>The Modern Dilettante will have been in boyhood a shorn lamb, for whom
it was necessary to temper the wind of an English education by a liberal
admixture of foreign travel. A prolonged course of interrupted studies
will have filled him with culture, whilst a distaste for serious effort,
whether mental or physical, and an innate capacity for mastering no
subject thoroughly will have produced in him that special refinement
which is to the Dilettante as a trade-stamp to Britannia metal. In
after-life, he will speak with regretful fondness, and with an accuracy
which he fails to apply to other matters of his "days" (four in number)
at a German University, and will submit with cheerfulness to the
reputation of having drunk deep from the muddy fountains of metaphysical
speculation, which are as abundant and as ineffective in Germany, as her
springs of mineral water.</p>

<p>Having passed his period of storm and stress without committing any of
those follies or indulging in any of those excesses by which the parents
of ordinary young men are afflicted, he will arrive without reproach at
the borders of an apparently blameless middle age, and, finding himself
after the death of his father, in the enjoyment of a settled income of
considerable size, he will set up in life as an acknowledged amateur of
all that is truly precious. In order that nothing may be wanting to him
for the proper pursuit of this calling, he will gather round him a
little band of boneless enthusiasts, who after paying due devotion to
themselves, and to one another, will join him in worshipping the dead or
living nonentities whose laurelled photographs adorn his rooms. He will
cover his couches with soft silks, his walls will be hung with
impressionist etchings and engravings of undraped ladies of French
origin, <i>terra-cotta</i> statuettes principally of the young Apollo, will
be placed in every corner, and a marble bust of the young <span class="smcap">Augustus</span> will
occupy the place of honour next to the grand piano, on which, will be
ranged the framed cabinet photographs of interesting young men. Each
photograph will bear upon it an appropriate inscription, announcing it
to be, for instance, a gift "From <span class="smcap">Bobby</span> to <span class="smcap">Toddlekins</span>." Nothing more is
necessary for the perfect life of dilettantism, except to settle an
afternoon for tea, and an evening for music. When this is done the
Dilettante is complete.</p>

<p>It is curious, however, that although he aims at being considered a
poet, an artist, a dramatist, and a musical composer, the Dilettante
rather affects the society of those who are amateurs of imperfect
development, than of those who have attained fame by professional
effort. Yet since his nature is tolerant, he does not exclude the latter
from the scope of his benevolence, and they may occasionally be seen at
his parties, wondering how so strange a medley of second-rate
incompetencies can have been gathered together into one room.</p>

<p>It is noticeable, that the Dilettante loves the society of ladies, and
is not averse to encouraging amongst his intimates the belief, which
none of them holds though all express it, that he is in reality a
terrible fellow and much given to the destruction of domestic happiness.
He finds a sense of rest and security in fancying that he is suspected
of an intrigue. But it is somewhat remarkable, that the evil tongues
which make sad havoc of many unwilling reputations are very slow to
gratify the willing Dilettante in this respect. No Dilettante can be
considered genuine, unless he expresses a pitying contempt for
everything that is characteristically English, and for the unfortunate
English who are imbued with the prejudices of their native land. He
gives a practical expression to his scorn by quavering in a reedy voice,
the feeble <i>chansonnettes</i> of an inferior French composer, and by
issuing a volume of poems in which the laws of English Grammar are
trampled under foot, and the restrictions of English metre are defied.
In his lyrical effusions he breathes the passionate desire of a great
soul for Love that is not of the earth. He aspires to the stars, and
invokes the memory of dead heroes, his intimates. He sets out to win
imperishable glory amidst the embattled ranks of his country's foes. He
lashes the cold and cruel heartlessness of the world with a noble scorn.
He addresses the skeletons of departed friends with passionate longing.
He finds that life and its gaudy pleasures are as dust and ashes in the
mouth.</p>

<p>Having read these efforts to an admiring circle, he betakes himself with
infinite zest to the discussion of aesthetic tittle-tattle over a cup of
tea and a toasted bun. "Dear fellow," his friends will say of him at
such a moment, "he is so etherial; and his eyes, did you observe that
far-away, rapt look in them?" They will then take pleasure in persuading
one another without much difficulty, that they are the fine flower of
created beings.</p>

<p>The Dilettante, moreover, is a constant attendant at the first nights of
certain theatres. He figures with equal regularity as a large element in
the society gossip of weekly journals. He is a delicate eater and never
drinks too much out of the Venetian glasses, which his butler ruthlessly
breaks after the manner of domestics. There is amongst the inner circle
of the Dilettanti a jargon, both of voice and of gesture, which passes
muster as humour, but is unintelligible to the outer world of burly
Philistines. They dangle hands rather than shake them, and emphasise
their meaning by delicate finger-taps. Their phrases are distinguished
by a plaintive cadence which is particularly to be remarked in their
pronunciation of the word "dear."</p>

<p>At charitable concerts in aristocratic drawing-rooms the Dilettante is
in great request. On these occasions, he astonishes and delights his
friends with a new song, of which, he will have composed both the words
and the music, if he may be believed, whilst he was leaning from his
casement "watching the procession of the moon-lit clouds." He sometimes
smokes cigarettelets (a word must be coined to express their size and
strength), but he never attempts cigars, and loathes the homely pipe. In
gait and manner he affects a mincing delicacy, by which he seeks to
impress the thoughtless with a sense of his superior refinement. In
later life, he is apt to lose his hair, and to disguise the ravages of
time upon his cheeks by the aid of <i>rouge</i>. Yet he deceives nobody, and
having grown stout and wheezy is eventually carried off by a common cold
in an odour of <i>pastilles</i>. He will be buried in a wicker-work coffin
covered with lilies, and a rival Dilettante having written a limp and
limping sonnet to his memory, will take his evening.</p>

<h2>COMIC SLAUGHTER!</h2>

<center>(<i>The Story of the Next Battle, written in advance for Next Month's
"Powder Magazine," by a Soldier in the Ranks.</i>)</center>

<p>The Victory of Rumtumidity was certainly one of the most amusing things
I ever saw in my life. We landed at six o'clock in the evening, and
finding a grog-shop, were soon gone coons. Speaking for myself, I saw
the colours of the Regiment magnified by twenty! Well, we were ordered
to march, and off we started, staggering along in fine style. Out came
the moon, and one of us fell down in a dead faint.</p>

<p>"Suffering from sunstroke!" said the Surgeon, who was a Welsh Irishman.
"Leave him in the sand, and he will soon come to himself when he finds
you gone&mdash;if he doesn't, the vultures will hasten his movements."</p>

<p>This jest made us all laugh. Our Captain hearing one of us roaring a
trifle too loud, put his sword through him. Immense!</p>

<p>We marched along to the music of the prisoners, who yelled out bravely
when they were prodded by the guards set over them.</p>

<p>"Did you see the like!" said <span class="smcap">Tim O'Flanagan</span> (from Edinburgh), who, no
doubt, would have developed the idea, had not his head at that moment
been carried off by a cannon-ball. Very comic!</p>

<p>"Now, my lads," said our Captain, who wasn't much of an orator, "look
here&mdash;England expects every man to do his duty; and, if you don't, why
<i>I</i> am having you all watched, and, as sure as beans is beans, the
laggards will be bayoneted."</p>

<p>This little speech had the desired effect, especially after it had been
strengthened by a double ration of grog.</p>

<p>Then came the order to charge. We charged, and killed everyone we saw,
including our own officers. This simplified matters. A little later the
whole place was in our hands. Rumtumidity was taken!</p>

<p>Then came the order to bury the dead. But we did more&mdash;<i>we buried the
living with them</i>! Oh, how it made us laugh! Then came supper, and we
amused ourselves by telling to one another our adventures. I was just
recounting how I had emptied the pockets of a deceased officer,
when&mdash;"whisk!"&mdash;up came a cannon-ball and struck me! I was able to say
nothing more at that time; as, when the cannon-ball had passed, I found
it had left me defunct! And I have been dead ever since. My companion
and chum, whose name I must not give without permission, will vouch for
every word I've said.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the good old rule that, "You should never look a gift-horse in

Nation as to other things. Nevertheless, Mr. <span class="smcap">Tate's</span> munificent proffer

<p><i>Cassell's Cabinet Portrait Gallery.</i> In Number One are met together the
Duke and Duchess of <span class="smcap">Fife, Sarah Bernhardt</span> as <i>Theodora</i>, and the
Archbishop of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>, the last very properly looking another way. In
Vol. II. there is rather a nice one of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Stirling</span> and <span class="smcap">Mary Anderson</span>,
but the photographer ought to have been more careful about the little
finger of <span class="smcap">Mary's</span> right hand. In Vol. III., <span class="smcap">James Payn</span>, reading a
manuscript, with his spectacles up on his forehead, is very good. The
picture of H.R.H. the Prince, in uniform, is too dark, and his
expression is severe. Charming and clever Miss <span class="smcap">Maud Millett</span> is in Part
IV., followed by the Duke of <span class="smcap">Westminster</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Lewis Morris</span>, the Poet
looking so awe-struck, that he must have been taken by surprise, and
been "struck like it." Miss <span class="smcap">Anna Williams</span> leads off No. V., and, to
express it musically, she is accompanied by the Duke of <span class="smcap">Connaught</span>. Sir
<span class="smcap">James Linton</span> appears for the Water-colourists. In Part VI. the face of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank Lockwood</span>, Q.C., M.P., is full of light and shade, more light
than shade, fortunately, and it is a really good likeness. The Duchess
of <span class="smcap">Leinster</span> looks lovely, and Sig. <span class="smcap">Piatti</span> uncommonly wise as he guards
his 'cello.</p>

<p>Neatly and concisely done is Mr. <span class="smcap">Besant's</span> <i>Captain Cook</i>, published in
the <span class="smcap">Macmillan</span> Series of <i>English Men of Action</i>. He discovered the
Society Islands, whence, of course, are obtained our present supply of
Society Papers. The natives of these Society Islands made great use of
their Clubs, some of which proved fatal to Captain <span class="smcap">Cook</span> and his men.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Cook</span>, had he been alive now, would have been among the first to
appreciate <i>The Pocket Atlas</i>, in which the names of the chief places
are clear enough for all practical purposes. There are seventy-two maps,
and the publisher bears the honoured name of <span class="smcap">Walker</span>, though the map is
not specially intended for the use of pedestrians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Macmillan &amp; Co.'s</span> cheap edition of <span class="smcap">Charles Kingsley's</span> works is
deservedly popular; easy to carry, good clean type, so that those who
ride may read. <i>Two Years Ago</i> is just out. By the way, the same firm's
<span class="smcap">Charlotte Yonge</span> and the other <span class="smcap">Kingsley</span> Series, make a noble show in a

<h2>"O RARE 'BEN'!"</h2>

<p>In aid of The Actor's Benevolent Fund, the Irving Amateur Dramatic Club
are going to give a performance of <i>Henry IV. (Part I.)</i>, at the Lyceum
Theatre, Saturday afternoon, March 29, when in consequence of H.R.H. The
Princess of <span class="smcap">Wales</span> having accorded her gracious patronage, the Welsh song
will be sung by Miss <span class="smcap">Eleanor Rees</span> on the stage, as <i>Lady Mortimer</i>,
which will be a melodious illustration of rhyme and <span class="smcap">Rees</span>-on. The

and the Vice, with numberless virtues, is Mr. <span class="smcap">Justin McCarthy</span>, M.P.,

drawer would have been an immense attraction. If <span class="smcap">Justin</span> Junior could
play the other Drawer, the attraction would be doubled. "Sure such a
pair!" But we must not jest in too Shakspearian a manner. We hope the

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<center>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</center>

<p><i>House of Commons, May 9.</i>&mdash;This has been great occasion for Windbag
<span class="smcap">Sexton</span>. Excelled himself, and there is no other point of comparison
useful or usable. <span class="smcap">Saunderson</span>, who always takes friendly views of his
countrymen opposite, pleads that <span class="smcap">Sexton's</span> windbaggism is partly due to
his birth. In Ireland, he assures me, a mile is longer than in other
parts of the Empire; and so, kind-hearted Colonel pleads, some allowance
should be made for <span class="smcap">Sexton</span> when he gets on the oratorical tramp. That's
all very well; but, for a man to talk two hours and three-quarters in a
so-called Debate, is even more than the national tendency towards
exaggeration illustrated by the Irish mile will excuse. Why couldn't
<span class="smcap">Sexton</span> have windbagged on some day of last week? Suppose, for example,
his self-sacrificing friends had made a House for him at a quarter to
nine on Friday night, and he had then talked for three hours and a
quarter?&mdash;or on Wednesday there was opportunity; whilst openings might
have been made on Tuesday or Thursday.</p>

<p>"No, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," said <span class="smcap">Sexton</span>, when I suggested this in interests of House and
public time, "you're a well-meaning fellow, but you don't understand
everything. You see in debate of this kind all principal men stand off
till the last day. We might have twinkled on several days of last week,
but we prefer to coruscate on last night. Sure of an audience; Whips
out; crowds in; excitement everywhere. I and <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>, and <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Balfour</span>, all save ourselves for the last night. Can't all speak,
perhaps, especially if I get on first: but they must take their chance.
With the Universe waiting and listening for me, other things and other
people must stand aside. Very serious thing to disappoint the Universe."</p>

<p>So <span class="smcap">Sexton</span>, rising at five o'clock, with the windbag conveniently
disposed under arm, pumped and pumped away for two mortal hours, and an
odd three-quarters that seemed more than mortal. <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span> waiting to
make a speech; <span class="smcap">Arthur Balfour</span> longing to be at 'em. Members knowing what
was in store, "expecting," as <span class="smcap">Sheehy</span> said, that "every moment would be
his next." But <span class="smcap">Sexton</span> flowed on for ever, with aggravating pauses, with
a smile of sublime, unruffled satisfaction, that made the position ten
times as aggravating as it otherwise would have been. To smile and
smile, and play such a villanous trick as this on a suffering House was
worse than most disordered fancy painted.</p>

<p>"If," said <span class="smcap">Arthur Balfour</span>, in one of his agonised asides, "the fellow
did not undisguisedly enjoy such supreme happiness, our lot would be
more bearable."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>. "Bad enough, I admit. But do you know
why persons are sometimes killed by having a charcoal fire in their
bedrooms? Because the carbon of burning charcoal unites with the oxygen
of air, and forms carbonic acid gas, which is a narcotic poison. So it
is here. <span class="smcap">Sexton</span> has got hold of some good points; he is not inapt as a
speaker; if his inordinate vanity had only permitted him to be satisfied
with occupying time of House for half an hour, or, say, three-quarters,
he would have made damaging speech; as it is, he wearies House to death,
swamps us all and himself in waste of verbiage, and the people he
attacks escape in the general misery. In other words, his carbon of
burning vanity, uniting with the oxygen of opportunity, forms a speech
two hours and three-quarters long; which is a narcotic poison."</p>

<p>Mr. G., with the ardour of youth, and the training of an athlete,
proposed to himself to hear what <span class="smcap">Sexton</span> had to say. Accordingly took up
convenient seat below Gangway. Stayed there an hour. Then walked back an
altered man; shattered; aged; almost in a state of coma.</p>

<p>"Well, you ought to have known better," I said, somewhat sharply, having
no sympathies with these vagaries.</p>

<p>"And I was so well and strong when I entered the House," Mr. G. said,
wearily. "Quite elate with my correspondence with <span class="smcap">Tyndall</span>. Didn't you
think that a nice turn in the concluding sentence?&mdash;'My only desire is
to meet you on the terms on which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> long ago, we stood when, under my
roof, you gallantly offered to take me up the Matterhorn, <i>and
guaranteed my safe return</i>! Wouldn't trust myself on the Matterhorn with
<span class="smcap">Tyndall</span> now;" and Mr. G., warily shaking his head, walked forth in
search of rest and refreshment.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Mr. G.'s Amendment to <span class="smcap">Old Morality's</span> Resolution on
Parnell Commission Report negatived by 339 votes against 268.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;This has been <span class="smcap">Grandolph's</span> night. Broke the silence of the
still young Session with memorable speech; been in diligent attendance
on Debate; sat through interminable speeches with patience only excelled
by Mr. G.; sometimes looked as if were about to deliver his soul; but
succeeded in bottling it up. To-night soul drove out the cork; burst
the bottle, so to speak.</p>

<h4>The Reverberating Colomb.</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandolph</span> a man of many phases. Tonight presented himself in his highest
character; a statesman; a champion of constitutional principles at
whatever expense to prospects and sensibilities of his most revered
friends on Treasury Bench and elsewhere. Quite a new style of speech for
<span class="smcap">Grandolph</span>, testifying to remarkable range of his genius. Nothing
personal: free from acrimony; inspired with profound, unfeigned,
reverence for constitutional principles. Here and there a touch of
pathos as he recalled former times when, as <span class="smcap">Dizzy</span> said of <span class="smcap">Peel</span> on a
famous occasion, "they had been so proud to follow one who had been so
proud to lead them."</p>

<p>Awful splutter in Ministerial circles. A gleam of delight flashed
through the shadow when it was discovered that <span class="smcap">Jennings</span> had rebelled
against <span class="smcap">Randolph's</span> new revolt. "Ha! ha!" said the <span class="smcap">Reverberating Colomb</span>,
after <span class="smcap">Jennings</span> had made his speech, "the army has dismissed its
general."</p>

<p>This all very well; not here concerned with <span class="smcap">Grandolph's</span> relations with
his Party or his faithful friend; merely note that the speech itself
lifts <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span> once more into the very front rank of political
personages. The Liberal Party cannot ignore nor the Conservatives
dispense with the man who made that speech.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jokim</span> not a particular friend of <span class="smcap">Grandolph's</span>. "Leg quite on other boot,"
as <span class="smcap">Sheehy</span> says. But he did the enemy a service to-night. To complete
<span class="smcap">Grandolph's</span> triumph it only required that some Member of the Ministry
whose ineptitude he had demonstrated should rise and, with loud voice,
ungainly gestures, drag the Debate down from the heights to which it had
been lifted, debasing it by personal attacks hoarsely shrieked across
the table at former friends and colleagues. <span class="smcap">Jokim</span> did this amidst
uproarious cheers from <span class="smcap">Johnston</span> of Ballykilbeg, who began to think that,
after all, there is something in the Right Hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Old Morality's</span> Motion carried.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Attempt by some noisy outsiders who know nothing of House
to make things unpleasant for <span class="smcap">Akers-Douglas</span>, because House Counted Out
last Friday. Said he has been wigged; assume he will retire. All arrant
nonsense. Everybody in House, Conservative, Liberal, Dissentient, Irish,
whatever we be, all know <span class="smcap">Akers-Douglas</span> as one of best Whips of present
generation. Assiduous, persuasive, courteous, yet firm; always at his
post, never fussy, never cross, apparently never tired, he is a model of
a Whip. His Party could better spare an occasional Secretary of State.</p>

<p>For purely business arrangements Ministers have a unique combination of
three men. <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>, as Leader of House; <span class="smcap">Akers-Douglas,</span> as Whip; and
<span class="smcap">Jackson</span>, as Financial Secretary, are strong enough to balance effects of
any reasonable amount of blundering in high politics. They take care of
the pence of efficiency and popularity, and leave the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> an
occasional pound to spend.</p>

<p><i>Business Done.</i>&mdash;New Irish Land Bill brought in, and cast out.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Teynham</span> on in the Lords, but what he's on about the Lords
only know, and not all of them. Something to do with Camperdown;
<span class="smcap">Granville</span> not entirely out of it; and the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span> at least compromised.
<span class="smcap">Teynham</span>, standing at Cross Benches, holding on to the rail of Bench
before him, as if he were in pulpit, swings about his body, turns to
right and left, sometimes presenting his back to <span class="smcap">Lord Chancellor</span>, whilst
he contemplates emptiness of Strangers' Galleries. In plaintive voice,
full of tears, he babbles o' Camperdown, green fields, <i>nemine
contradicente</i>, and Standing Order No. XXI.</p>

<h4>A Mental Struggle.</h4>
</div>

<p>Pretty to watch <span class="smcap">Hobhouse</span> whilst <span class="smcap">Teynham</span> on his legs. Sits intently
listening; first crossed one knee, then the other; puts his two
forefingers together as if connecting the matter of <span class="smcap">Teynham's</span> speech;
gradually, as muddle grows thicker, two locks of hair on top of his head
slowly rise and remained standing, as it were, till <span class="smcap">Teynham</span> reseated
himself. Most remarkable testimony to mental struggle. Even <span class="smcap">Hobhouse</span>,
having thus given his mind to it, couldn't make out what <span class="smcap">Teynham</span> was at.
As for <span class="smcap">Denman</span> he, after first ten minutes of speech, flouted out of
House.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Toby</span>," said he, passing me in the Lobby; "if this is what the House of
Lords is coming to, I shall vote with <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> for its immediate reform.
Don't like to say anything disrespectful of a Peer; but I must observe
that <span class="smcap">Teynham</span> is a little lacking in coherency. His observations fail in
point; in short, if he were not a Peer I should say his mind was
wandering. Whatever we do, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, let us be intelligent <i>and</i>
intelligible. I trust I am not prejudiced, but I really can't stand
<span class="smcap">Teynham</span>."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Commons, Government defeated, in resisting <span class="smcap">Hamley's</span>
proposal to stump up for Volunteers.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trevelyan</span> brought forward Motion proposing that
Parliament shall rise at beginning of July, making up necessary time in
winter months. Supported proposition in speech graceful and strong, a
model of rare combination of literary art, with Parliamentary aptitude.
After brisk debate, resolution negatived by 173 votes against 169. "A
majority of four won't long stand in our way," said <span class="smcap">Charles Forster</span>, who
having, some Sessions ago, fortuitously found his hat, never now deserts
it.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Government vainly tried to get into Committee of
Supply.</p><br />

<hr /><br />

<center><span class="smcap">The Difference.</span>&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">George Trevelyan</span> wants the House of Commons to
"rise at the beginning of July." <i>Mr. Punch</i> wishes it to rise at all
times&mdash;above rowdyism.</center><br />
